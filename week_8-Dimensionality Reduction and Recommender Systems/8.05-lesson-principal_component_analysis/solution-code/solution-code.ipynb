    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction refers to **reducing the dimension of our feature space**. Less technically, this is (approximately) the number of features we use in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dimensionality reduction has a number of advantages:\n",
    "- Increases computational efficiency when fitting models.\n",
    "- Can help with addressing a multicollinearity problem.\n",
    "- Makes visualization simpler (or feasible).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dimensionality reduction can suffer from some drawbacks, though:\n",
    "- We've invested our time and money into collecting information... why do we want to get rid of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction can generally be broken down into one of two categories:\n",
    "- **Feature Elimination**\n",
    "    - In feature elimination, we drop variables from our model.\n",
    "- **Feature Extraction**\n",
    "    - In feature extraction, we take our existing features and combine them together in a particular way. We can then drop some of these \"new\" variables, but the variables we keep are still a combination of the old variables!\n",
    "    - This allows us to still reduce the number of features in our model **but** we can keep all of the most important pieces of the original features!\n",
