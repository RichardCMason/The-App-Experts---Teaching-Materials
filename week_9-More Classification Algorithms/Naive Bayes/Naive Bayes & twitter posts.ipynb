    "- If I'm explaining this to my non-technical peers, natural language processing is just a way for us to get computers to understand written language the way you and I do.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If I'm explaining this to someone with a more technical background, natural language processing is a set of tools that represent words as numbers. This is commonly done by feature engineering (i.e. turning words into columns in your dataframe), but more complicated methods exist.\n",

    "We'll cover NLP in detail later. In this case, we've already done the NLP for you where we turn social media posts into features. You and I will use these features in a Naive Bayes classification model to predict whether a post comes from Twitter or Facebook."
